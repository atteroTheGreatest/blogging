Oh well, it should be latex.
==

I used this post: [supporting latex in octopress](http://chuchao333.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/supporting-latex-in-octopress/)

To enable this, I used kramdown and mathjax, look at [changing markdown to kramdown http](://jeffvautin.com/blog/2012/12/30/changing-the-octopress-markdown-engine/)

Here is a very simple example of latex:

$$
 \xi = 15 \\
 \frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = 6xf - 88
$$

I love writing articles in latex and after writing some recently, I thought about reposting it here.
Now I have my tools. Stay tuned.
