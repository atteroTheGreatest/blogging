###Importance of cryptography

I really haven't thought much about cryptography untill now. Also about a security as a whole. I treated paranoia of some of my sysops friend as just another quirk of their unusual behaviour or whatever.

I just push it out of my mind unconsiously. It's not my job. I don't know it, I don't really want to worry about and event try to think about what bad could happen. It would stress me out, wouldn't it? I'm not a good Dr Doom.

However it's extremly naive and I can see that. I encountered this behaviour in different fields so many times - I wanted to be in my comfort zone. Luckilly, my different part of personality loves challenges and rationalism too much to have stable comfort zone.

Recently I read an [article](link) on hackernews about cryptography and it inspired me, to change my attitude, learn about cryptography and think about security of systems I build and maintain.

###Cryptography enineering

I started reading this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Cryptography-Engineering-Principles-Practical-Applications/dp/0470474246). I read first chapter and it sounded pretty sane and interesting too me. This book can be treated as a course material, there are even recomendations of how to divide in in 10, 12 or 6 weeks.

I enjoyed the text. It's pleasure to read. It's clear and well structured. 

Excercises! Yes, this book offers nice excercises to practice your new acquired skills. I was surprised by the elaborate manual of writing report for excercise and at least a bit overhelmed by it and amount of excercises, because I'm naturally lazy and new too subject - so it's double hard. But I plan to take my time and do them, if not all, at least a representive half.

Thinking about methods to break securities and commit crimes without punishment and not feeling wrong about it (think like your enemy) could be really refreshing and insightful.

###World isn't only books

The real test of thinking well in security domain would be building real system that would satisfy at least basic security demands.
