##Today morning markdown was for me the same thing as a markup.

Just a silly word. However it turns out to be a markup language which is very
useful in blogging. I tried to learn some of it from wikipedia and
the article which I found was pretty informative.

Try [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Editors)
or [this](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#overview).

###Why should I use it?

It's simple and easy to write. Writing < and all those html tags can be pretty
tedious and you always can miss some, and usually output looks like a mess.
At least for me. But there are solutions for this problem - markup languages!
