###I hate closed science

I study physics at WUT. It's pretty normal that I'm interested in it and that I want to read articles about subjects which interest me or just to learn if I'm really interested in them or not.

But I usually can't.

And I feel bad about it. Today I was interested in researching some various fields of physics, because I have to choose my next project. There are various options, many of which I haven't heard of before.

First step is usually googling new thing. There is something there usually. But there is a wall. Wall of paywall which is pretty outrageus. I want to check out 30 subjects (it's a number of basic options I have). But
one article costs aproximatelly $40. How am I supposed to read this? I don't have 30 * $40 = $1200 just to check out some new fields of interest which could change my carrier.

With computer science/engineering it's a completely different matter. At least in my past experience, I could easily learn amazingly lot of different things without paying a cent. And I actually don't mind paying, if the sum isn't bizzare of course. But, as young person I didn't have many possibilities to earn enough money in the past. And my learning/researching desires are insatiable and usually imminent.

There are amazing resources about learning programming languages, you can learn this way python, erlang, haskell, lisp, lua and many others. Also - there are amazing courses at coursera, udacity, edx, and similar platforms.

But they are usually pretty introductory, but some also are very demanding - computer architecture at coursera, etc.

###Open science
There are some initiatives to open our closed science:

http://pantonprinciples.org/

http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090820/0153145940.shtml

Now, I just have to read all of this links (and probably more) to learn how actually looks open science and it can be really beneficial to me in various fields.
